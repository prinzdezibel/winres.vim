1. Intro                                              *winres-intro*

Winres.vim is a window resize utility that allows to resize buffer
windows in a sane and intuitive manner. This meand no complex 
character sequences involved and of course no mouse movement needed.

====================================================================
2. Commands                                        *winres-commands*

:WindowResize <direction>

  <direction>  up, down, left, right

Resizes the focused window through moving the reference border in the 
given direction. Reference border is the right border of 
the window for horizontal resizes and the bottom border for vertical
resizes. If there's no more right-most (resp. bottom-most) window,
the reference point for the resize action is the left window border
(resp. top window border). The window is resized

3. Keymapping                                    *winres-keymapping*


For GUI enabled Vim versions the following keys are mapped:

  <D-S-Right>   Win/Command + Shift + Right arrow  :Winresize right
  <D-S-Left>    Win/Command + Shift + Left arrow   :Winresize left
  <D-S-Up>      Win/Command + Shift + Up arrow     :Winresize up
  <D-S-Down>    Win/Command + Shift + Down arrow   :Winresize down

For non-gui Vim versions the following keys are mapped by default:
(Because there seems no way to map non-standard keys like Command/Win)

  <C-Right>   Win/Command + Shift + Right arrow  :Winresize right
  <C-Left>    Win/Command + Shift + Left arrow   :Winresize left
  <C-Up>      Win/Command + Shift + Up arrow     :Winresize up
  <C-Down>    Win/Command + Shift + Down arrow   :Winresize down
